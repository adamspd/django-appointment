## Bug Fixes üêõ

---

- Fixed a bug where a stack trace was displayed when a user that is staff but didn't have a staff member profile tried
  to access its appointment's page list (/app-admin/user-event/)

  #### Description of the bug
  If a staff (Django-related role) is authenticated and tries to retrieve this endpoint :
  `/app-admin/user-event/` he'll get the following error if debug = true
    ```
      Traceback (most recent call last):
      File ".../django/core/handlers/exception.py", line 55, in inner
        response = get_response(request)
                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      File ".../django/core/handlers/base.py", line 197, in _get_response
        response = wrapped_callback(request, *callback_args, **callback_kwargs)
                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      File ".../appointment/decorators.py", line 26, in wrapper
        return func(request, *args, **kwargs)
               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      File ".../appointment/decorators.py", line 39, in wrapper
        return func(request, *args, **kwargs)
               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      File ".../appointment/views_admin.py", line 39, in get_user_appointments
        appointments = fetch_user_appointments(request.user)
                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      File ".../appointment/services.py", line 44, in fetch_user_appointments
        staff_member_instance = user.staffmember
                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      File ".../django/utils/functional.py", line 268, in inner
        return func(_wrapped, *args)
               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      File ".../django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py", line 492, in __get__
        raise self.RelatedObjectDoesNotExist(
        client.models.UserClient.staffmember.RelatedObjectDoesNotExist: UserClient has no staffmember.
    ```
  If debug = false, the user will get a 500 error
  #### To Reproduce
  ##### Steps to reproduce the behavior:

      Create a user/account (user1)
      Login as admin/superuser (admin) and add user1 to staff.
      Login as user1 and go to /appointment/app-admin/user-event/
      See error

  #### Expected behavior
  Not an error but a redirection or anything more concise than just an error or a 5xx code return.
