# Django Appointment üì¶

## Admin Views üë©‚Äçüíº

### Overview üîç

The Django Appointment System's admin module comes packed with a set of views designed to manage appointments, staff
members, services, and more. Both superusers and staff members have unique access rights to ensure data integrity and
confidentiality.

### üö® Important Note üö®

When extending the base template in your admin custom templates, ensure that you've included
the `{% block customMetaTag %}` inside the `<head>` section of your `BASE_TEMPLATE`. This block contains crucial meta
tags, such as the CSRF token, which is essential for the proper functioning of AJAX requests.

Example:

```html

<head>
    <title>My title</title>
    ...
    {% block customMetaTag %}
    {% endblock %}
    ...
</head>
```

Failure to include this block might result in errors during asynchronous operations due to a missing CSRF token.
