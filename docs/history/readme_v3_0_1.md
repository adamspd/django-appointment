for more information.

### Breaking Changes in version 3.0.1:

See the [release notes](https://github.com/adamspd/django-appointment/tree/main/docs/release_notes/latest.md) for more
  information.

## Quick Start üöÄ

1. Add "appointment" to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting like so:

   ```python
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       # other apps
       'appointment',
   ]
   ```

2. Incorporate the appointment URLconf in your project's `urls.py` like so:

   ```python
   from django.urls import path, include
   
   urlpatterns = [
       # other urls
       path('appointment/', include('appointment.urls')),
   ]
   ```

3. In your Django's `settings.py`, append the following:

   ```python
   AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'models.UserModel'  # Optional if you use Django's user model
   ```

   For instance, if you employ a custom user model:

   ```python
   AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'client.UserClient'
   ```

   If you're utilizing the default Django user model, there's no need to add this line since Django automatically sets
   it to:

   ```python
   AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'auth.User'
   ```

   Ensure your `create_user` function includes the following arguments, even if they are not all utilized:

   ```python
   def create_user(first_name, email, username, last_name=None, **extra_fields):
       pass
   ```

   This function will create a user with a password formatted as: f"{APPOINTMENT_WEBSITE_NAME}{current_year}"

   For instance, if you append this to your `settings.py`:

   ```python
   APPOINTMENT_WEBSITE_NAME = 'Chocolates'
   ```

   And the current year is 2023, the password will be "Chocolates2023". If `APPOINTMENT_WEBSITE_NAME` is not provided,
   the default value is "Website", rendering the password as "Website2023".

   This name is also utilized in the footer of the emails sent to clients upon scheduling an appointment:

   ```html
   <p>¬Æ 2023 {{ APPOINTMENT_WEBSITE_NAME }}. All Rights Reserved.</p>
   ```

4. Execute `python manage.py migrate` to create the appointment models.
5. Launch the development server and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ to create appointments, manage
   configurations, and handle appointment conflicts (the Admin app must be enabled).
6. You must create at least one service before using the application on the admin page. If your service is free, input 0
   as the price. If your service is paid, input the price in the price field. You may also provide a description for
   your service.
7. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/appointment/request/<service_id>/ to view the available time slots and schedule an
   appointment.
